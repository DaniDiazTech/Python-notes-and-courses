# ______init___

If __init__ is defined within a class, it is automatically invoked when we create a new class instance. 

The __init__ method specifies what attributes we want the instances of our class to have from the very beginning

# self

The self argument represents a particular instance of the class and allows us to access its attributes and methods.

# class instances:

If classes are an abstraction, a template for similar objects, a class instance is a sort of example of that class, a particular object 
that follows the structure outlined in the class. In your program, you can create as many objects of your class as you need.

# Bonus: double underscore

Double Pre Underscores tells the Python interpreter to rewrite the attribute name of subclasses to avoid naming conflicts.

Name Mangling:- interpreter of the Python alters the variable name in a way that it is challenging to clash when the class is inherited.
