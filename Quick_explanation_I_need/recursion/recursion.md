A function that is recursive is a function that is calling it self a certain amount of times

# IN PYTHON:

In python there is a limit of recursion that is 1.000.
This is to prevent crashing of the program because an infinite recusion function call.

you can set other recursion limit with sys:

sys.setrecursionlimit("the rexursion limit you want")

recursion is really important for create some algorithms, but sometimes it has a bad time completition like O(2 ***** n)
